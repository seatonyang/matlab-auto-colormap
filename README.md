# matlab-auto-colormap

When drawing in MATLAB, if the data distribution of the matrix is very uneven, the visual effect of the drawn window is very poor. This function implements adaptive color mapping, so that regardless of the matrix data distribution, a 3D image with good visual effect can be drawn.



## how to use&#x20;

Run the "matlab\_auto\_colormap" script, while the "test\_mat.mat" is a mat for testing.
